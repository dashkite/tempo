- [x] It appears Katana’s test and branch functions pass the entire stack into the predicate. This has led to bugs in at least two places: the Bora app and Tempo’s verify subcommand. This is interesting because the test command is apparently succeeding anyway and because the natural thing seems to be to simply call apply on the predicate. I think I was going to do that and changed my mind because I was still thinking I could combine test with pop. At any rate, that needs to get fixed and that will cause the scope check to actually do something. (It hasn’t mattered up until now because I’ve always just run verify without the scope, so that might be a misfeature.)
- [ ] The exemplar combinators aren’t quite working: or, rather they’re working a bit too well. We use the module path to resolve files for comparisons, but those aren’t copied by the build process. So we either need to adjust the path to account for the build directory or we need to move the files along with the rest of the module. Or perhaps it’s just that the files aren’t included in the module? But it appears to be looking within the build the directory.
- [ ] The Tempo Exemplar package needs to be spruced up and published. It might be nice to have tests for the combinators as well. And the same is true for the Builder package.
- [ ] We also need to extract/prepare/publish the Ethical and Basic packages. Should we make it possible to bundle multiple builders together? I’m not sure how we’d reference that in the exemplars field.
- [ ] Once everything is published, we need to make sure that Tempo can run with the published versions.
- [ ] We can potentially just use GitHub references for the packages. I was able to just pass the URL into require for the files, so maybe that will just work for GitHub, too?
- [ ] We need to move the packages description file out of Gists, since every change alters the URL, which gets tedious. I hate imposing the requirement that the file is public, which … should it just be a list of packages? Again, we could thus just reference a GH repo. (Of course, that increases our dependence on GitHub, but maybe you can use Git URLs, also?)
- [ ] We currently always install every exemplar for every package. We could probably just install them when they run the first time (and only create them once, with an check to see if they’re already installed).
