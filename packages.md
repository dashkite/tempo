# Package Configurations

Originally, Tempo just looked for a `packages.yaml` file in the directory in which it was running. This makes a certain amount of sense, especially because the package paths are relative. So the ideas was to put a packages file in the root of each directory where you wanted to manage a polyrepo. The problem was how to share that file, especially since it imposed an implied directory structure. And we have multiple “collections” of repos: that’s the whole idea behind a “polyrepo” architecture. We want to build and release *related* modules together, rather than treat *all* our repos as one big polyrepo. So we need to share a configuration that covers these collections, which means that either we have multiple `packages.yaml` files, or we need a way to indicate which collection we’re referring to, in which case, there’s little value in relying on the current directory structure to organize things.

The most convenient means to share potentially private configurations is via `git clone`. NPM requires that you have a paid account (or run your own registry). Either way, we need some means to copy a configuration file, or a set of configuration files, and it sort of makes sense that you might want to manage multiple such configurations together anyway.
